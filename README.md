## Project Overview
This project utilizes data analysis and visualization to explore AirBnB pricing patterns, revenue trends, and the influence of variables like bedroom count and zip codes on pricing. The primary tool used for visualizations is Tableau, the dataset includes information from various AirBnB listings bookings on the calendar with varying prices depending on the season.
I investigate the pricing trends of the AirBnB properties based on various the factors and also include an analysis of the revenue generated over the course of an year.

### Key Insights:
- **Avg Price Per Bedroom**: Shows how the average price of AirBnB listings varies with the number of bedrooms.
- **Price Per Zipcode**: Displays how AirBnB pricing fluctuates across different zip codes.
- **Revenue for Year**: Illustrates the revenue growth over time for AirBnB properties.
- **Distinct Count of Bedrooms**: Analyzes how the number of bedrooms correlates with property counts.
